## 4.1. What are Non-login AI Tools?

#

**Non-login AI tools** refer to AI services that can be used instantly via a web browser without requiring separate account registration or login. Examples include:

- Image generation : [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/), [DeepAI](https://deepai.org/), [Stable Diffusion Playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion)
- Text-based Q\&A : [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
- Video generation (partially non-login) : [Bing Video Creator](https://www.bing.com/create)

## 4.2. Advantages of Non-login AI Tools

#

1. **Fast and convenient access**: No need to create an account, so access is quick and easy.
2. **Privacy protection**: No personal info or account linking required, reducing the risk of data exposure.
3. **Beginner-friendly**: No complicated setup or software installation, making them suitable for newcomers.
4. **No cost burden**: Most services are completely free, with no cost involved.  

## 4.3. Disadvantages of Non-login AI Tools

#

1. **Limited features and lower quality**
   * Fewer functions compared to account-based services.
   * Lower output quality (e.g. image resolution, accuracy) than paid tools.

1. **Storage and management limitations**
   * Often lacks saving or reloading functionality.
   * Users must save results manually to their local PC, making reuse cumbersome.

1. **Usability for continuous work**
   * Often one-time use or session-limited, making long-term use difficult.
   * Not ideal for complex or extended projects.

1. **Server and speed issues**
   * May slow down or crash during high traffic.
   * Delays or errors can occur when many users access the service.
