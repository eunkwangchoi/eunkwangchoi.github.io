### Artist | Writer | Researcher

I studied aesthetics and philosophy at Seoul National University. I spent some time teaching at Kyungnam University but eventually left academia to devote myself fully to creative work. My projects often begin with a focus on text. During this period of rapid technological change, I explore the evolving status of text through various media experiments. While new media are central to my work, I havenâ€™t turned my back on traditional forms.
