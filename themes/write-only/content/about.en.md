### Artist | Writer | Researcher

I am a multidisciplinary artist, writer, and researcher exploring the intersections of art, technology, and philosophy. My work focuses on the evolving role of text and media in the digital age, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence and multimedia art.

With a background in aesthetics and philosophy from Seoul National University, I have contributed to academia as a professor at Kyungnam University and participated in various AI research initiatives. In 2022, I founded Atelier Euro to further investigate the fusion of technology and artistic expression.

My creative practice spans literature, visual arts, and interdisciplinary research, examining the shifting boundaries between text and non-text in contemporary art. I seek to challenge conventional narratives, question the notion of "the end of art," and explore AIâ€™s potential in pure artistic creation.

Currently, I am expanding my portfolio to integrate AI-generated art and multimedia compositions, aiming to redefine the dialogue between human creativity and machine intelligence.
