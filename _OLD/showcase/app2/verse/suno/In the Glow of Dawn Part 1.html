[Verse]
In the glow of dawn we rise
Fleeing shadows sight unseen
Through the whispers of the skies
Healing hearts where pain has been

[Verse 2]
Hands
They fold in silent plea
Chasing doubts
We breathe anew
Under heaven’s canopy
Every soul is born to you

[Chorus]
Mercy’s wings embrace the lost
In your light we're found again
Every tear and stormy cost
Are mere ripples in the rain

[Verse 3]
Hallelujah echoes long
In the chambers of our hearts
Guided by your sacred song
Lighting each of our new starts

[Verse 4]
Echoes rise through broken night
Seeking solace in your grace
In the warmth of dawn's first light
We find hope in your embrace

[Chorus]
Mercy’s wings embrace the lost
In your light we're found again
Every tear and stormy cost
Are mere ripples in the rain
